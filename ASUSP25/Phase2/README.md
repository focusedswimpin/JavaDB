# HW2: Question and Answer CRUD Application

Welcome to **HW2**, a standalone Java application that implements **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations along with **input validation** for managing questions and answers.  
This project is designed based on the provided foundational materials, previous assignments (**HW1, TP1**), and insights from **Ed Discussion**.

---

## Features

- 📝 **Question & Answer Management:** Create, read, update, and delete questions and answers efficiently.
- ✅ **Input Validation:** Ensures all inputs are valid, preventing empty or duplicate entries.
- 🔍 **Search and Filtering:** Retrieve subsets of questions and answers dynamically.
- 🔧 **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Implemented with well-documented test cases.
- 📊 **UML Class and Sequence Diagrams:** Provides architectural documentation.
- 💻 **Java Console Application:** Runs as a standalone CLI-based Java program.

## Purpose

This project aims to:

1. Implement **CRUD operations** for managing questions and answers with input validation.
2. Store and retrieve **subsets of questions and answers** dynamically.
3. Ensure robust functionality through **test-driven development (TDD)**.
4. Provide clear **UML Class and Sequence Diagrams** to illustrate system design.
5. Demonstrate Java programming proficiency in a **structured and scalable** manner.

## Test Cases

✅ Positive Test Cases

Creating a valid question should succeed.
Creating a valid answer should succeed.
Listing all questions and answers should return valid data.
Updating existing questions and answers should reflect changes.
Deleting existing questions and answers should remove them.

❌ Negative Test Cases

Adding a blank question should trigger an error.
Adding an empty answer should trigger an error.
Updating a non-existent question should fail.
Deleting a non-existent question should fail.
Entering duplicate questions should be prevented
